        So what would happen is, when browserify encounters these requires, it's going to process them and replace whatever is in here with the actual library.
        And whenever it encounters my eRequire command, it'll work just like node.js.

     *  So we're going to use another node.js item called path.
     *  Path, allows us to create cross platform directory references.
     *  Then I'm going to use the resolve method of path to go to the proper directory
     *  Back up a level (that's why these two dots are right there) and then find the file called data. Find the folder called data and then in there find the file called data.json.
     *  This how we'd get the data file.
     *  The resolve command is going to make this cross platform compatible.

/**
* Notes:
* Most of the time with React we would use a life cycle method to import some data and perhaps an AJAX call to bring that data in
* But because we have node.js we can just use the require command and the file system to bring in files.
* We do have to be a bit careful with require commands because of what's happening when you're also working with a process that uses browserify.
